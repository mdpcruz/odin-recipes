    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Wherever you come from, there is a big chance you are a pizza lover!
            This is our take on one of the most famous dishes of all time. You might
            need a lot of cheese...</p>
        <p>Our team has discussed their must-haves on any pizza recipe, and we managed
            to gather them all in this one. <em>Spoiler alert: it's amazing!</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200g strong bread flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp instant yeast</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>100ml passata</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
            <li>1 crushed garlic clove</li>
            <li>125g sliced mozzarella</li>
            <li>Shaved parmesan</li>
            <li>Basil leaves (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. 
                Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon 
                until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins 
                until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, 
                but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. 
                Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. 
                On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. 
                The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two 
                floured baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking
                 tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with 
                 cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, 
                 on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more 
                 olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
        </ol>
